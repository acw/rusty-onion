The most important thing to realize about this repository is: **This is a hobby
project, that I am using to learn how to write Rust.**

This repository has no association with the [Tor
project](https://www.torproject.org/). You should use their stuff. It's very
cool, and they do very cool work.

Just to aid in the process of you not accidentally using this project, or
thinking that it's ready for deep review, there's not much here on master.
Instead, since I'm currently working on fetching and parsing key peer databases,
most of the work I'm doing is on the [parsing](/acw/rusty-onion/tree/parsing)
and related branches.

With all the above caveats in mind, I am using this project to learn Rust. If
you'd like to take a look, and suggest more idiomatic ways for me to do things,
I'd love to get some advice.
